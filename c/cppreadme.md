In order for this program to work a suitable big int library must be used.  You can use the one provided or implement your own c++ bigint library of choice and replacing the "bigint" with your own class/object.  The only requirements is that the big integer object must have the accessible methods "add","multiply", and "tostring()".  In other words if A is your big integer 
object and B is another object then A.add(B) returns A+B.
